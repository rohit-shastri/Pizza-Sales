# Pizza Sales
The Pizza Sales Project is all about using data to make a fictional pizza restaurant chain better. They collect information about what people buy and when, then use special tools like SQL and Power BI to understand it. By studying things like popular pizza flavors and when people buy the most, they can give advice on how to sell more pizza and make customers happier. This helps the restaurant chain run smoother and make more money.
